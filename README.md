# Techdegree-Project-2
 The second techdegree project


 In this project, you'll build a responsive, mobile-first layout using HTML and CSS. The layout should demonstrate an understanding of responsive design by adjusting to accommodate small, medium, and large screen sizes.

You will write CSS to style the page for a small mobile device first. Then, using min-width media queries, youâ€™ll add breakpoints to adjust the layout for wider tablet and desktop screens.

NOTE: The Front End Web Development Techdegree is meant to train you in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and let you practice and show your mastery of these fundamental building blocks of the web. Because of that, please avoid using frameworks like Bootstrap, Foundation, Skeleton, and so on for this project. Even though you may end up using frameworks like these professionally, you still need to know and be able to implement designs with your own knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

In addition, please avoid submitting any projects that rely on a server-side technology like PHP or Ruby on Rails.
